      Summer is here! You know what that means.. <strong>SMOOTHIES!</strong> Now
      what is Summer without them? Sure, we have our lovely lemonades and our
      other favorite beverages, but nothing beats a refreshing smoothie by the
      pool, campfire, beach, barbecue grill, Grandma's house, or even after a
      great workout session. You get the idea.

      What I specifically love about these recipes is that they are for those
      who are lactose intolerant! Okay, I know what you're thinking, but hear me
      out. As I've gotten older, I ended up becoming a member of the lactose
      team. Having to adjust my dairy intake and make crucial changes to my
      diet, has become quite challenging for me. In the beginning of something
      new, it took me awhile to accept the fact that I have to change my ways
      because everything that I liked always caused an upset stomach, and being
      stubborn I had to suffer the consequences afterwards. Never would I wish
      this on anyone!
      <br />
    </p>
    Growing up in a big family, me being number 7 out of 18, it was rare to be
    lactose. As for me being lucky number 7, I out of everyone in this family
    became a member of the lactose intolerant team. Until, one of my older
    sisters gave birth to her eldest child, however she became lactose at a much
    earlier age. (That's another story, but I don't want to lose track of why
    I'm creating this! Please stick with me!) Anyways, as I was looking for ways
    to enhance my taste for what I grew up loving, it took me a while to get
    used to this change. What assured, or rather "awaken" my senses to accept
    that I can't have what I love, is the consequences that I've unfortunately
    endured after devouring a delicious homemade meal. Again I would never wish
    this on anyone! With my stubbornness to add to the journey of being lactose
    intolerant, I finally gave in and started doing my research!
    <p>
      I know there are a <strong>lot</strong> of different recipes that I
      could've chosen that were vegan, or lactose-free, however I've decided to
      put together my
      <a href="./smoothie-recipes.html"
        ><strong>top 3 favorite smoothie recipes</strong></a
      >
      and yes, one including our furry friends too! (A favorite that our family
      dog actually enjoyed the most - hence being a picky eater!) Thinking at
      the exact time that I'm creating this, I thought it would be only fit to
      create a webpage for what's fitting for the time of year,
      <strong>SUMMER</strong>!
